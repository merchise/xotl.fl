=====================
 Roadmap of releases
=====================

All release before 1.0 are unstable, we may skip finalizing one of the release
if we find our plan was not feasible.

The plan
========

Release plan
------------

- 0.3.0  Parser complete.
- 0.4.0  Type checker/inference complete.
- 0.5.0  Runtime complete.

Features
--------

All those releases should have all the planned features including:

- Pattern matching
- Type classes and instances
- ADTs


Non-feaures
-----------

There are some features which I don't know if we need:

- Record types and sub-typing.

Those could be included in any of the releases, but the release could be done
without them.
